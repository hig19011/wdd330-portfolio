  <h1>Notes</h1>

  <h2>Testing</h2>
  <ul>   
    <li>System Errors - error that occur outside of app code - rare, but unavoidable when they occur</li>
    <li>Programmer error - error in app code logic</li>
    <li>User error - user enters invalid data, does an unexpected order of operations or some other interaction issue</li>
    <li>Exceptions - error that can't be handled correctly by the program - dividing by zero or internet outage</li>
    <li>Stack trace - sequence of function calls that led up to a specific point, often an exception</li>
    <li>Warning - a unexpected issue that doesn't stop a program from functioning like an exception does. These can often led to issues later in the program.</li>
    <li>Avoid setting the code up to create silent failures.  These lead to greater problems down the road. Always handle failures, including logging them and notifying the user when appropriate.</li>
    <li>Use "Strick Mode" to ensure better programming practices. Add <code>'use strict'</code> to the top line of your code.</li>
    <li>Modules from ES6 automatically use strict mode, so you don't need to declare it.</li>
    <li>Linting tools can analyze code for issues and point out error and place for improvement.</li>
    <li>All JavaScript feature aren't supported by all browsers. Use feature detection by trying to use a feature before running the code that would make use of the feature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Debugging</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Alert function can be used to provide a poor mans break point.  It stops the code from running at its usage allowing you a chance to review the application state.</li>
    <li>The console is where we can log output for debugging purposes, i.e. <code>console.log(`I am ${age} years old`);</code> to display the value of $age</li>
    <li>The method call <code>console.trace()</code> will display the current stacktrace in the console.</li>
    <li>Most browser have a debugger where you can step through your JavaScript code as it runs</li>
    <li>The debuggers allow you to set a breakpoint where you can pause the program execution.  This allows you to see what is happening in your code at that point, line by line.</li>
    <li>The keyword "debugger" will force a breakpoint in the code. Always remove this keyword before releasing your code for use.</li>
    <li>The "Error" object can be created by the browser or the application and will at least contain the name of the error, message about the error and a stacktrace of when the error occurred.</li>
    <li>There are many typed Error object used for specific issues.</li>
    <li>Error object are thrown when Exceptions occur.</li>
    <li>Exceptions are handled using try, catch, and finally blocks of code.</li>
    <li>The try block holds the code that might cause and exception.</li>
    <li>The catch block holds the code that deal with an exception if it occurs.</li>
    <li>The finally block is optional, if included will always run its code regardless if an exception was thrown or not.  It is good for clean up used resources</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tests can identify errors early in development process.</li>
    <li>Tests can help reduce the brittleness of the code.</li>
    <li>Test-driven Development or TTD</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This process involves writing test before writing the code.</li>
      <li>The test should always fail, because there isn't any code to support them yet.</li>
      <li>Then you write the code the test will use until the test passes.</li>
      <li>Later when you refactor the code, the test should either pass or need refactoring to match.</li>
      <li>Repeat</li>
      <li>This process is referred to as "red-green-refactor"</li>
      <li>Use judiciously, it isn't appropriate for every scenario.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>There are a number of robust Testing Frameworks.</li>
    <li>Jest is a common one made by Facebook and is used in this weeks examples.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I may have questions after getting some more time to work with classes, mixins and imports, but right now I have no questions. </li>
  </ul>
